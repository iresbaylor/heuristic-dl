# heuristic-dl

Very quickly implemented...
To run,
create a model first. This is done in learning.py:

python3 learning.py

To execute model (on hardcoded test bench):

python3 run_model.py

To randomly generate example code snippets to train on (must then be copied to training_data.json):

python3 create_training_data.py
